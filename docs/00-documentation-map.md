## 1. Purpose

This document lists every document the project needs, from discovery to
production: what each one must contain, which tier it belongs to, and in
which order to write them. It is the index of the documentation set.

- If a document is not listed here, it does not exist yet.
- If a topic is not owned by a document listed here, nobody is
  responsible for it.

The goal is that **at the end of Phase 1, a reader can understand the
whole product from documents alone**: who uses it, what it does, which
rules it enforces, how every amount is computed, and what "done" means.
Phase 2+ documents then explain how it is built, secured and operated.

IDs below are proposals. Renumber if you prefer, but keep them stable
once other documents reference them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Review of the existing documents — fix before continuing

Findings marked ✅ are fixed; their text describes the problem as it was found, kept for history.

Reading Phase 0 and Cahier des Charges 00 together surfaced issues that affect several
downstream documents. The **blocking** ones should be resolved before
writing Cahier des Charges 01, because roles and permissions depend on them.

| Problem | Finding in Phase 0 and the Cahier des Charges Général | Why it matters | Resolved in | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Problem 1 | ✅ *Fixed 2026-10-08 — the product now covers both rental and sales.* **Sales had been added without a Phase 0 decision.** Cahier des Charges 00 made real-estate sales and prospects/buyers first-level domains (D-005) and renamed the product from "Property Management ERP" to "Real Estate Operations ERP". Phase 0 was rental-only at the time: its target customer, personas, golden workflow, MVP/V1/V2, success criteria and competitor set contain no sales, and its non-goals exclude "a real-estate agency CRM" (Cahier des Charges 00 §20 quietly rewords this to "un CRM généraliste"). | Phase 0 itself sets the rule (§0.29): a scope change gets a decision record. Without one, Phase 0 and Phase 1 describe two different products. | Decision Log (new decision D-008) + Product Definition update | **Resolved** — Phase 0 §0.29, Cahier des Charges 00 v0.2 |
| Problem 2 | ✅ *Fixed 2026-10-08 — both seller models supported (D-008).* **The sales business model was undefined.** Cahier des Charges 00 mixed two different businesses: an *agency* selling on mandate for owners ("selon mandat", commissions) and a *developer* (promoteur) selling its own stock with payment schedules, often off-plan (*vente sur plan*), which also brushes against the "not a construction ERP" non-goal. There is also no internal sales actor: §4.1 still lists only Admin, Manager, Finance and Technician. | The two models have different actors, contracts, money flows and documents. Cahier des Charges 05/06 cannot be written without picking one (or both, staged). | D-008 + Product Definition (new persona) | **Resolved** — both models, one workflow (D-008); Sales Agent persona added |
| Problem 3 | ✅ *Fixed 2026-10-08 — basic sales in the MVP (D-009).* **Sales had no MVP staging.** Vendors received a precise MVP/V1/V2 split (§0.29); sales did not, and UC-011 to UC-016 sit at the same level as rental. | Scope explosion is Phase 0's first listed risk. | Scope & Roadmap Matrix | **Resolved** — basic sales in MVP (D-009) |
| Problem 4 | *Partly fixed 2026-10-09 — "Renter" is the person or company who rents; "tenant" means an organization, as in multi-tenancy (glossary N-01).* **"Tenant" meant two things.** *Multi-tenant* (a customer organization of the SaaS) vs. *Tenant* (locataire). Same collision for "Owner" (property owner vs. organization owner) and "Organization" (client company vs. vendor company in §0.23). | The collision will leak into the data model (`tenant_id` on a lease?), permissions and UI. | Glossary — e.g. reserve "Tenant" for the locataire and call the SaaS customer "Organization" | **Resolved for "Tenant"** — [glossary](reference/01-glossary.md) N-01; "Owner" and "Organization": proposed, N-02 to N-04, to confirm |
| Problem 5 | **Which external actors log in at MVP?** The §16 matrix gives owners, renters, vendors and buyers access, but Phase 0 puts the vendor portal and the advanced owner portal in V1 and the renter portal as a "foundation". | Each external login changes the identity model, the attack surface and the test scope. | Cahier des Charges 01 + Scope & Roadmap Matrix | **Resolved** — only internal staff log in to the MVP (D-010, [scope matrix](reference/05-scope-matrix.md) §2) |
| Problem 6 | **Can an external actor span several organizations?** A vendor, owner or renter may deal with two customer organizations on the platform. Is a vendor a record inside each organization (simple, isolated), or a platform-level account linked to several (one login, harder isolation)? | This is the hardest multi-tenancy question in the product and shapes the identity model. | Cahier des Charges 01, Conceptual Domain Model | **Deferred to V1** — no external login in the MVP (D-010); decide in Cahier des Charges 01 before V1 |
| Problem 7 | **Missing actor: the platform operator.** Nobody provisions organizations, suspends them, handles support access to customer data, manages plans/subscriptions, or exports and deletes an organization's data on offboarding. | Every multi-tenant SaaS needs this, and support access is a classic cross-tenant risk. | New Cahier des Charges 12 | High |
| Problem 8 | **The core money flow of property management is not specified:** management fees (honoraires de gestion), owner remittances (reversements), owner balances, security deposits held on behalf of renters, income split between co-owners. | Phase 0 asks "how much is due to the owner?" but no document owns the answer, and owner statements depend on it. | Cahier des Charges 07, Cahier des Charges 03, Conceptual Financial Model | High |
| Problem 9 | **The accounting boundary is undefined.** "Not a full SAP accounting suite" says what it isn't. Is it a sub-ledger (balances computed from transactions), an internal double-entry ledger, or a system that exports to the customer's accountant? | Shapes the whole finance data model; very expensive to change later. | Decision at the start of Cahier des Charges 07 | High |
| Problem 10 | **Local legal and tax rules are not inventoried.** Phase 0 says not to hard-code legal conclusions, but the rules to check are not listed: VAT on commercial rents, withholding tax (retenue à la source) on rent paid by companies, timbre fiscal and invoice numbering rules, possible e-invoicing obligations (TTN), lease registration, deposit rules, personal-data law (Loi organique 2004-63, INPDP) including transfers of personal data abroad, e-signature validity, legal retention periods. | Finance depends on the tax rules; the cross-border transfer rules constrain the choice of cloud region. | Regulatory & Legal Register, validated with an accountant / lawyer | High |
| Problem 11 | **Local payment reality is missing.** Cheques (including post-dated and bounced), cash, transfers and bills of exchange (traites) behave differently: a cheque is received, deposited, then cleared or bounced. Also, TND has **3 decimal places** (millimes). | A payment model built only for bank transfers, or money stored with 2 decimals, will be wrong. | Cahier des Charges 07, Cahier des Charges 14 | Medium |
| Problem 12 | **State machines already disagree.** Work order: Phase 0 has `WAITING` and `CANCELLED` but no `CLOSED`; Cahier des Charges 00 has `CLOSED` but no `WAITING`/`CANCELLED`. Invoice: Phase 0's statuses (`RECEIVED`, `APPROVED`, `REJECTED`) describe a vendor bill (payable); Cahier des Charges 00's (`ISSUED`, `PARTIALLY_PAID`, `VOID`) describe a customer invoice (receivable). Two different objects share the name "Invoice". | Inconsistent lifecycles become inconsistent code and reports. | Glossary (e.g. *Invoice* vs. *Vendor Bill*) + State Machine Catalog | Medium — naming proposed (Glossary N-05, N-07); statuses still to align in State Machine Catalog |
| Problem 13 | **Phase 0 is not done by its own definition of done:** competitor research, vendor capability comparison, evidence-backed differentiation and customer validation have no documents, and there is no Phase 0 freeze. | Phase 1 is being built on unvalidated hypotheses. | Competitor Analysis to Customer Discovery & Validation, Phase 0 Freeze Note — or record them as deferred with the risk accepted | Medium |
| Problem 14 | **Non-functional requirements are qualitative only:** no availability target, RPO/RTO, response time, data volume or retention duration. | Architecture choices and tests need numbers. | Cahier des Charges 11 | Medium |
| Problem 15 | **No data onboarding.** Target customers live in spreadsheets. Without importing properties, owners, renters, leases and opening balances, a new customer cannot start. | Adoption blocker; also the fastest way to load demo data. | New Cahier des Charges 13 | Medium |
| Problem 16 | **Scope edges never decided:** condominium management (*syndic de copropriété*; Phase 0 even lists "Syndic Digital" as a competitor), seasonal/short-term rentals (common locally, distinct from the Airbnb non-goal), recoverable charges and utility re-billing (charges locatives, STEG/SONEDE), and renter ↔ company messaging vs. notifications only (Phase 0 lists "communication" as a renter need; WhatsApp is today's channel). | Each one silently changes the size of a domain. | Decision Log + Scope & Roadmap Matrix | Medium — listed in Scope & Roadmap Matrix §7; syndic proposed Out |
| Problem 17 | **A unit can be sold while leased.** Ownership must be effective-dated (who owned it on which date), so rent, expenses and owner statements split correctly at the transfer date. One person can also be owner, renter and buyer at once. | Easy to design in from day one, painful to retrofit. | Cahier des Charges 02, 03, 05; Conceptual Domain Model | Medium |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Documentation principles

- **One owner per topic.** Each topic is defined in exactly one
  document; others reference it. Example: a lifecycle is defined in the
  owning cahier and collected in State Machine Catalog, never re-defined elsewhere.
- **Stable IDs.** `D-xxx` decisions, `Q-xxx` open questions, `R-xxx`
  risks, `UC-xxx` use cases, `BR-<DOMAIN>-xxx` business rules,
  `NFR-<CATEGORY>-xxx` non-functional requirements, `AC-xxx` acceptance
  criteria, `Architecture Decision Record numbers` architecture decisions. Referencing by ID is what
  makes traceability (Requirements Traceability Matrix) possible.
- **Standard header** on every document: ID, title, version, status
  (`Draft → In review → Baseline → Superseded`), date, depends on,
  changelog.
- **Decisions are superseded, never silently edited** — the pattern
  Phase 0 already used in §0.29 for vendors.
- **Language rule (decide once).** Proposal: cahiers may be written in
  French; entity names, states, permissions and IDs stay in English
  because they appear in code and APIs; the glossary gives the FR / EN /
  AR equivalents. Cahier des Charges 00 already works this way — make it explicit.
- **Living vs. frozen.** Reference documents live through all
  phases. Phase documents are frozen at the phase gate and then change
  only through a decision.
- **Docs as code.** Markdown in this repository, diagrams as code
  (Mermaid / PlantUML), reviewed like code.
- **No abbreviations.** Write words in full: "Problem 4", not "F-04";
  "Cahier des Charges 01", not "CdC 01"; "Phase 0 §0.13", not
  "P0 §0.13". Abbreviations cause misunderstandings.
- **Keep them short.** Most documents are tables or one-pagers. Architecture Decision Records
  are one page each; several Phase 2 artifacts (OpenAPI, physical ERD)
  are generated from or maintained with the code. The heavy writing is
  in Cahier des Charges 01 to Cahier des Charges 14.

## 4. The document set

**Tiers**

- **A — Understanding baseline.** Needed to understand the product and
  take structural decisions. Complete before writing production code.
- **B — Build.** Written before or while building the part it covers.
- **C — Run & launch.** Needed before production use or publishing the
  portfolio.

### 4.1 Reference documents — living, all phases

| Document | What it must contain | Tier |
|---|---|---|
| [Glossary / Lexique](reference/01-glossary.md) — *v0.1 draft* | Every business term: definition, FR / EN / AR names, synonyms to avoid, owning domain. Resolves Problem 4 and Problem 12. Also the source for UI translations of business terms. | A |
| Decision Log | All product and scope decisions (`D-xxx`): context, decision, consequences, superseded-by. Migrates Phase 0 §0.29 and Cahier des Charges 00 D-001 to D-009. Technical decisions go to Architecture Decision Records (Architecture Decision Records). | A |
| Open Questions Register | `Q-xxx`: question, why it matters, which document it blocks, owner, due date, answer → decision link. Takes over Cahier des Charges 00 §23. | A |
| Risk Register | Phase 0 §0.25 risks with likelihood, impact, mitigation, owner, status. Reviewed at each phase gate. | A |
| [Scope & Roadmap Matrix](reference/05-scope-matrix.md) — *v0.1 draft* | One table: every capability × `MVP / V1 / V2 / Out`. Scope is currently scattered over Phase 0 §0.13–0.15, §0.29 and Cahier des Charges 00 §20. | A |
| Requirements Traceability Matrix | `BR / NFR → UC → entity → API endpoint → test → release`. Started in Phase 1, filled during build. Proves the golden workflows are fully covered. | B |

| Regulatory & Legal Register (Tunisia) | One row per legal/tax assumption (Problem 10): rule, source, product impact, validated by / when, status. Nothing tax- or law-sensitive is built on an unvalidated row. | A |
| Phase 0 Freeze Note | One page: what is validated, what is deferred with accepted risk, frozen decisions, Phase 1 inputs. | A |

### 4.3 Phase 1 — Functional specifications (cahiers des charges)

## 5. Recommended writing order

Cahier des Charges 00 §26 names Cahier des Charges 01 as the next document. A short **Step 0** should
come first: Cahier des Charges 01 defines roles and permissions, and those depend on
Problem 1 to Problem 6.

| Step | Documents | Why at this point |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | ~~Sales decision; Product Definition and Cahier des Charges 00 updated; Glossary v0.1; Scope & Roadmap Matrix v0.1~~ (done 2026-10-08 — naming and scope proposals to confirm); Decision Log, Open Questions Register and Risk Register migrated from existing text | Problem 1 to Problem 3 resolved; Problem 4 naming proposed in Glossary; Problem 5 resolved and Problem 6 deferred to V1 by D-010. Small documents, a few days of work. |
| 1 | Competitor Analysis, Vendor Capability Comparison, Customer Discovery & Validation, Regulatory & Legal Register, then Phase 0 Freeze Note | Runs in parallel with steps 2–8. Regulatory & Legal Register must exist before Cahier des Charges 07; interviews should happen before the rental, sales and maintenance cahiers are frozen. |
| 2 | Cahier des Charges 01 + Cahier des Charges 12 → Authorization Matrix v1 | Identity is the foundation of every other domain; the platform operator is one more role in the same model. |
| 3 | Cahier des Charges 02, Cahier des Charges 03 → Conceptual Domain Model v1 | The real-estate reference data every workflow points to, including effective-dated ownership. |
| 4 | Cahier des Charges 07 part 1 → Conceptual Financial Model v1 | Lease, maintenance and sale all create financial records. Fixing the accounting boundary, money model and payment instruments first avoids redesigning each domain later. |
| 5 | Cahier des Charges 04, then Cahier des Charges 07 part 2 (rent, deposits, owner remittance) | The primary business loop. |
| 6 | Cahier des Charges 08 + Cahier des Charges 09 together, then Cahier des Charges 07 part 3 (expenses, vendor bills) | Work orders and vendors are one workflow with two performer types. |
| 7 | Cahier des Charges 05 + Cahier des Charges 06, then Cahier des Charges 07 part 4 (sale payments, commissions) | Basic sales is in the MVP (D-009), so these cahiers are needed in full for the MVP scope; V1 / V2 items only need to be outlined. |
| 8 | Cahier des Charges 10, Cahier des Charges 13, Cahier des Charges 14, Cahier des Charges 11 | Transversal: they consume what the domain cahiers produce (events, documents, reports, NFR needs). |
| 9 | the domain modeling documents consolidated, Requirements Traceability Matrix started, Phase 1 freeze | Check consistency across cahiers; answer the exit questions in §7. |
| 10 | Architecture Vision & Principles, initial Architecture Decision Records, Security Architecture, Threat Model, Data Protection & Privacy, Test Strategy, then Tier B | Phase 2. UX can start in parallel from step 9. |

## 6. Standard structure of a detailed cahier

Every cahier (Cahier des Charges 01 to Cahier des Charges 14) uses the same skeleton so the domain modeling
documents can be consolidated mechanically. Sections that don't apply
are kept and marked "N/A".

``` text
1.  Objet et périmètre            in / out, MVP / V1 / V2 (→ Scope & Roadmap Matrix)
2.  Acteurs et permissions        role × action × scope (→ Authorization Matrix)
3.  Glossaire du domaine          new terms (→ Glossary)
4.  Concepts et entités           business attributes, cardinalities (→ Conceptual Domain Model)
5.  Workflows                     diagrams + narrative
6.  Cas d'utilisation détaillés   UC-xxx (→ Use Case Catalog)
7.  Règles métier                 BR-<DOM>-xxx, numbered and testable
8.  Cycles de vie                 states, transitions, guards, actor (→ State Machine Catalog)
9.  Événements métier             emitted / consumed (→ Business Events Catalog)
10. Impacts financiers            records created, amounts, balances (→ Cahier des Charges 07, Conceptual Financial Model)
11. Documents                     attached / generated (→ Cahier des Charges 10)
12. Notifications                 event → recipient → channel (→ Cahier des Charges 10)
13. Audit                         which actions are audited (→ Cahier des Charges 10)
14. Reporting / KPI               reports and indicators (→ Cahier des Charges 10)
15. Interactions inter-domaines   references to other cahiers
16. Exigences non fonctionnelles  domain-specific (→ Cahier des Charges 11)
17. Critères d'acceptation        AC-xxx, Given / When / Then
18. Questions ouvertes            Q-xxx (→ Open Questions Register)
19. Décisions                     D-xxx (→ Decision Log)
```

## 7. Phase 1 exit test — "global understanding"

Phase 1 is complete when someone who has never seen the project can
answer each question **from the documents alone**:

| Question | Answered by |
|---|---|
| Who are all the actors, and what can each one see and do? | Cahier des Charges 01, Authorization Matrix |
| Step by step, what happens in each golden workflow, and which records are created? | Acceptance Scenarios & Reference Dataset, Business Events Catalog |
| How is every amount on an owner statement computed? | Cahier des Charges 07, Conceptual Financial Model |
| What are all the states of each record, and who can change them? | State Machine Catalog |
| What is in MVP, what comes later, what is never built? | Scope & Roadmap Matrix |
| Which legal and tax assumptions are validated, and which are not? | Regulatory & Legal Register |
| What does the system promise in numbers (availability, recovery, performance)? | Cahier des Charges 11 |
| Does every term have exactly one meaning? | Glossary |
| Why was each structural choice made? | Decision Log |

If one question cannot be answered, Phase 1 is not done.
